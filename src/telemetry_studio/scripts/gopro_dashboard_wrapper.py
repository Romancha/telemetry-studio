"""Wrapper for gopro-dashboard.py that applies telemetry-studio runtime patches.

This script serves as a drop-in replacement for gopro-dashboard.py,
applying patches for:
- Timecode extraction and preservation (Final Cut Pro compatibility)
- Enhanced FFmpeg options (audio copy, metadata preservation)
- DJI SRT camera metrics preservation (when --ts-srt-source is provided)

Usage:
    python gopro_dashboard_wrapper.py [gopro-dashboard.py arguments...]

The wrapper:
1. Applies runtime patches to gopro_overlay library
2. Locates and executes the original gopro-dashboard.py script
3. Passes through all command-line arguments
